                <blockquote>
                <h5 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style mb-2 display-7"><strong>And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force. Matthew 11:12</strong></h5>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Delay is the only condition the Bible stated in Proverbs 13:12 that makes the heart sick and a sick heart eventually makes a sick body. God has prepared a great destiny for you but Delay is the strategy the enemy deploys to persuade you to subscribe for less. I want to quickly state that there is a major difference between waiting on the Lord and demonic delays and many Christians often have a misunderstanding where each applies. Everything that Jesus already paid for by his death, burial and resurrection, you don't need to wait on the LORD to receive them. For instance, you don't need to wait on the Lord for your sins to be forgiven, to be healed or to prosper but you can wait on the Lord to increase you from one level of glory to a greater glory. On the other hand, demonic delays are forces that want to deny you the divine privileges and rights to enjoy life and godlinessthrough poverty, sickness, barrenness etc and unless you become spiritually violent, the enemy will frustrate your entire destiny on a spot. Delays can expose the weakness of the strongest of all men. In the parable of the ten virgins in Matthew 25, when the Bridegroom delayed his coming, both the five wise virgins and the five foolish ones all slumbered and slept. If not for the delay in the coming of Isaac, Sarah would not have tempted Abraham with her maid which resulted to the birth of Ishmael who grew to become a thorn on their flesh and to their generation even to this day. The first king of Israel Saul, bowed to the pressure to please people in total disregard to divine order when Samuel delayed in coming to offer the priestly sacrifice and he lost divine favor to continue on the throne. I have met ladies that wanted to marry as virgins but only to end up distributing "sex gifts' to every boyfriend when they thought it would slay a husband for them by all means since they were 'running' out of time. I have met some holy women that had gone to unholy places in desperate search to end the delay in childbearing. I have met several young men that metamorphosed into thieves due to unemployment that crushed their self esteem. When a delay is allowed to proceed without spiritual violence, it will give an individual a bad name. The story of the woman with the issue of blood appeared in the Books of Matthew, Mark and Luke and yet we don't know her name because her condition which lasted for 12 years overshadowed her identity. God has commanded me to prophesy in this season, a wholesome baptism of a new name for his precious people and upon all that concerns them. Every negative adjective that people use in describing your identity shall be swallowed up now by the power of divinity. You are moving from being called the poor to being addressed as the rich. You are going from being called Mr bachelor and Miss spinster to an extremely happy marriage.
<br>
<br>I want you to decree loud after me, "by the precious blood of Jesus, I receive divine baptism for an instant change of name. No longer will I be called by a name that is contrary to the high calling of God upon my destiny. I am highly favored before God and people. I bear my fruits in season.  Nobody will ever have a demonic reason to call me barren in Jesus name!"
<br>
<br>Those secret tears every night are no longer necessary because it's your set time to win the war over that delay in your life and family once and for all. The Lord Jesus spoke concerning great troubles in the last days, "And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect’s sake those days will be shortened" Matthew 24:22. I prophesy that every evil rod of delay that is resting upon your inheritance of prosperity, fruitfulness, health and relationship to be broken right now so you will no longer put your hand to sin. I command every case of long sufferings in your family to be cut short and cut off suddenly by divine favor. I want you to continue in spiritual violence by speaking consistently according to the prophetic words that you have declared together with me just now. I want to charge you like God spoke to Moses before the Red Sea to stop asking God for what has already been spiritually given to you and start moving forward by calling those things to manifest physically in your life now. Remember a thousand years with man is like a day in the sight of God. In other words, what you think will naturally take you many months and probably years to achieve can be accomplished supernaturally in one moment of divine favor. Congratulations because that moment is here. Join me this Sunday at HeavenWorld Church Unlimited and experience an awesome testimony!<br><br><strong><em>Pastor Victor Orji
