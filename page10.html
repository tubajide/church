                <h5 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style mb-2 display-7"><strong>Welcome to 2016. Our prophetic year of Green Pastures. This is one glorious year that God will redefine every good thing in your life for the best and refine every bad thing that the enemy has ever fired against you into good news.</strong></h5>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4"><nttawo@gmail.com><bishopvictororji@yahoo.com><nttawo@gmail.com>&nbsp;It is interesting that God would give us such a special theme for the year when the economy of our nation and that of many developed countries of the world are in turmoil. The days when people flee the country for greener pastures overseas are now behind us as people living in many of those great countries are in search of where to escape for survival. I'm glad to let you know that wherever you may be living in the world at this moment, God has a green pasture that He has prepared specially for you to thrive more than ever and not just to survive anyhow. I prophesy to you that you and your family shall not run to and fro in search of what to do for a living as God will surely cause you to lie down in green pastures. It is interesting to note that in the ancient Israel where David took care of his sheep and wrote this beautiful Psalms 23, that most of the land was brown, rocky and barren. Green pastures are rare unless someone, usually the shepherd, has already gone to the trouble of clearing the rocks, plowing the soil, planting the seed, irrigating the land and carefully tending the grasses to be certain that his sheep have what they need. It is not the responsibility of the sheep to find green pastures but that of the shepherd and all that is required of the sheep is to follow him unto the place where they would lie down and enjoy. I'm glad to let you know that God has great pastures for you this year and even if what you need may be non-existent in your life or business environment, He will create a special type of the blessing for you to enjoy. </nttawo@gmail.com></bishopvictororji@yahoo.com></nttawo@gmail.com><br><br><nttawo@gmail.com><bishopvictororji@yahoo.com><nttawo@gmail.com>From Genesis 1:30, you will see that green is the first color to appear in the Bible. By divine law of first mention, this tells me that God will make your life very colorful in 2016 such that you will begin to naturally attract the right people and things that you have been struggling after in the past years. Every good thing that will be happening in your place of work this year, you will be the first to taste it before others. Another prophetic insight about the green color is mentioned in the last book of the Bible, Rev 9:4 where God commanded the angel of destruction 'do not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any GREEN thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads'. When you lie down in green pastures, you become an impossible case for any devil or evil persons to hurt you with sicknesses, failures or disasters. The green pastures is where you enjoy the blessings of God that makes rich and adds no sorrow with it. You need to understand that the Hebrew concepts of 'green pasture' does not only connote tender grasses  but also means "habitations" or "dwellings" as places where flocks and herds lie down for repose. This goes to fulfill Psalms 92:12 (NIV)'the righteous shall flourish like a palm tree, they will grow like a cedar of Lebanon; planted in the house of the Lord, they will flourish in the courts of our God. They will still bear fruit in old age, they will stay fresh and GREEN'. It is true that the green pasture experience is the birthright of every sheep in the kingdom but our great Shepherd has reserved it exclusively for those that are planted in a church. In this 2016, your church attendance must no longer be at your convenience but a matter of necessity, even unto active service within a church group. Mark 6:39. While feeding the multitude, "Jesus commanded (not suggested) that the men should sit in groups on the GREEN grass". There are no insignificant details in scriptures. </nttawo@gmail.com></bishopvictororji@yahoo.com></nttawo@gmail.com><br><br><nttawo@gmail.com><bishopvictororji@yahoo.com><nttawo@gmail.com>It is not just enough that the people came to hear His words or were willing to sit down in green grass to receive their food, but Jesus commanded them to sit in "groups". "Groups" speaks of opportunity for kingdom service in the Church unit. A brother in our church shared this testimony of how he was too busy with many business meetings that were often clashing with church meetings and yet he was never meeting up with his company's financial target month after month which got him more and more frustrated. Then after hearing my teaching on seeking the kingdom of God first and other things will begin to seek after you, he dedicated the next month to honoring God's meeting first before that of men. To the glory of God, within that same month, God brought new clients to him that gave him a financial transaction that far exceeded his company financial target for the first time.
<br>The Lord has more than enough in the green pastures for every need of your life in 2016 but He does not also waste them on unstable sheep that keep wandering from place to place without an active role in a church. In case you have been wandering in search of green pastures, search no further. It will be my honor and great joy to receive you at HeavenWorld church this year so that you will enjoy the Green pastures.
<br>
<br>Green Pastures represents abundant life and so I prophesy that you shall live life to the fullest, nothing of yours shall by any means dry up or die in 2016! Whatever you used to beg for in the past, I see God raising you into a position in 2016 where you will be giving them out freely. I see the wasted years of your marital relationship being restored in 7-fold to the envy of your enemies. I will surely hear your testimonies in Jesus name!
