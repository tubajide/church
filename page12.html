                <h5 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style mb-2 display-7"><strong>The first thing in the Bible that God said was "it is not good for the man to be alone".</strong></h5>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4"><nttawo@gmail.com><bishopvictororji@yahoo.com><nttawo@gmail.com>Adam was living in a perfect world and yet God found fault with loneliness. How much more then do we need a relationship in a corrupt world that is becoming overpopulated and yet many people are complaining of feeling more and more lonely.
<br>
<br>Loneliness kills slowly but a happy relationship is health to the heart and prolongs life. I know there are many in our society today that view marriage relationship as an experiment between two persons that hope they can endure and manage each other till death do them part. There are others that assume that marriage is simply a necessity for childbearing purpose instead of a happy union between a man and a woman to experience emotional, spiritual and financial development on a level that they can't function on their own individual efforts. Two are better than one.
<br>
<br>Many young people are getting their 'top coded secrets' for a happy relationship from their celebrity artists, actors and actresses in home videos whom most of them are so good with poor marriage statistics like infidelity, divorce and separation. It is so sad to see young people watching and listening to some of these 'super models' from Hollywood, Bollywood, Nollywood and other rotten woods giving people the best therapy for marital failure in the name of the latest trends for making a romantic home. Whereas many young people seem to have been carried away with all manner of unrealistic fantasies that will make them to enjoy their relationship. On the other hand, we have got many of our fathers and mothers who are still operating their marriage with the old template of tradition that is focused on obtaining first class in the University of Endurance with your spouse until one partner finally graduates unto death with masters in High Blood Pressure and Phd in Self condemnation.
<br>
<br>God is the founder of the marriage institution and his word remains the only guarantee to maximize happiness in any relationship. I believe by reading this material up to this point, you must have made up your mind to secure the future of your relationship and quit following the counsels of the ungodly of this world notwithstanding how popular or religious they might have been.
<br>
<br>The third chapter of the Bible introduced the first marriage on earth between Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden which failed to fulfill its divine purpose. Gen. 3. On the other hand, the last third chapter to the end of the Bible showed us another marriage between the Lamb of God (Jesus) and His Bride (the church) in heaven (Rev 19). I believe this is not just a coincidence as I strongly believe that every marriage needs a third party to guarantee peace when the storms of life arise and the fire of trials rage. The third party is not your In-law, nor court of law, but JESUS! No happy and successful relationship is a twofold cord but rather a threefold cord which cannot easily be broken. Ecclesiastics 4:9-12. The husband, the wife and Jesus makes the perfect 3-fold cord that can never be broken.
<br>
<br>I want to show you two divine secrets from this 'last wedding' in heaven that will happen at the end of the age that guarantees happiness in your relationship in the here and now.
<br>
<br>Earlier in the book of Revelation, Jesus appeared in different glory as the First &amp; Last, He that holds the 7 stars in His hand, He that has the sword in His mouth, the Lion of the tribe of Judah etc but when it got to his marriage event, He came as the Lamb. If you are going to enjoy a happy relationship as a man, you need the meekness of a lamb and not the fierceness of a lion of the tribe of your home. Meekness is not weakness but great strength wrapped up with humility. For instance, it is only weak men that beat up their wives but meek men use their words to handle their excesses. As the Lamb of God, Jesus took away the sins of the world, so as a man with a lamb's heart, you cover the weaknesses of your spouse and not use them to take advantage of her or for a public discourse, especially among your relations.
<br>
<br>I believe God commanded men to love their own wives because every man has the natural tendency to think they can manage more than one woman at the same time, especially when a flashy lady shows up and his own 'madam' is busy troubling him at home. The truth remains that no man has the capacity to succeed in more than one relationship at the same time. So better love your own wife and leave another man's burden. When we talk about love in relationship, what quickly comes to the mind of boys is sex but real men understand that word better. In fact, Love is spelled CARE.
<br>
<br>The bride at the marriage of the Lamb was adorned and she made herself ready. There are many young ladies that are ready for wedding but are no way prepared for marriage. A woman that always prepares herself as a bride will forever be the pride of her husband. There are many women that feel since they have finally 'arrived' in a man's house, that they don't need to keep a fit body, add knowledge to their brain and having won the human right to be his legal wife and stakeholder to all that the man has, they are made for life. Please don't follow this recipe for marital regrets because many that had put it to use are yet to recover from headaches and heart attack. God commands wives to submit to their own husbands because women have the natural tendency to yield to any man that pays attention to their emotional and financial needs. Don't marry a man you can't submit to or your life could become miserable. Submission is spelled RESPECT. Please wives don't expect much out of a man that can't feel your respect. It's only a man that believes in your respect that will always respond favorably to you. A man must not be perfect before he deserves your respect. In fact, if your husband has to demand respect from you, then you are losing your bridal touch to old wife's 'see finish '.
<br>
<br>I have been privilege to counsel many marriages and I have never seen any two persons that got engaged based on what they hate about each other and finally married just to fight over their differences for the rest of their lives. I'm using this illustration to help you to always remember the love and purpose that brought your relationship together in the first place. And I dare to declare unto you that even if your initial purpose for coming together was not based on true love, the grace of God that makes marriage easy shall begin to work wonders for you in the name of Jesus.
<br>
<br>I prophesy that every mountain before your marital fulfillment shall suddenly collapse before you now. In this season that many marriages are falling apart, your relationship shall be standing tall and strong in the name of Jesus. God will make your relationship a reference point to everyone and your marriage shall be everyday honeymoon. Go and put this word to work and I assure you that your happiness in your relationship is guaranteed!<br></nttawo@gmail.com></bishopvictororji@yahoo.com></nttawo@gmail.com></p></blockquote>
