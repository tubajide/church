                <h5 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style mb-2 display-7"><strong>This 2014 shall be more than just a good year, it shall indeed be a great year for you and your family. As we were approaching 2014, God gave me a special revelation of the glorious plans that heaven was about to release for the blessings of His people and also the perilous events that hell wants to unleash upon our nation.</strong></h5>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4"><nttawo@gmail.com><bishopvictororji@yahoo.com><nttawo@gmail.com>The Holy Spirit clearly showed me that the divine mystery for the church and our beloved nation in 2014  is hidden in the book of Genesis 14. Please take time NOW and read this chapter for a proper understanding of the prophecy. The year 2013 was actually the most trying times in our democracy which prophetically corresponded with the 13the year in verse 4 of Genesis 14 when rebellion actually broke out.  The spirits of rebellion have taken leading role in the demonic assaults of hell against families, churches and Nigeria since early 2013 but they shall not prevail against you. It was in the 14th year of the verse 5 of Genesis 14 that the real war actually broke out. In that revelation, it was shown to me that the winner and losers of the presidential election in 2015 shall be decided in 2014. Many people, including Christians are getting tired of praying for the peace and prosperity of this nation due to the unreasonable level of corruption in the government sector. But the truth that God showed me is that those who obey his instruction in 1 Timothy 2:1-4 &amp; Jeremiah 29:4-14 by standing in prayer for our leaders shall never lose their inheritance to the corruption of some of our leaders. Yea, even the great positions of influence in public and private sectors and the wealth of natural resources of this nation shall be supernaturally preserved for you and your posterity. Please take note of this divine warning; no matter the weight of your prayers, the length of your fasting and even the height of your giving, you will never prosper in Nigeria or any organisation that you despise or hate.
<br>
<br>The second instruction in that revelation was in respect to tithing. The first mention of tithes was in this same Genesis 14. Abraham was a man that encountered God and received great promises but until he released his tithes, he could not enjoy their realities and even further spiritual encounters. No wonder Genesis 15 began with... "After these things". Tithes is not a religious law but a universal law of wealth. It is just like the  law of gravity  which is not subject to your likes and dislikes. It is strictly in your best interest to comply with  it for real spiritual and financial prosperity. In the days of ignorance, God overlook. But when He grants you knowledge of a truth and you still ignore it, then He will overlook you in that area of life. That is why He lamented in Hosea 4:6 that My people are destroyed( not by witches and demons but) for lack of knowledge. (Please request for our DVD series on this subject for deeper understanding). The third instruction in this revelation which I consider as the most important was walking in fellowship with the Holy Spirit by praying often in other tongues.</nttawo@gmail.com></bishopvictororji@yahoo.com></nttawo@gmail.com><br><nttawo@gmail.com><bishopvictororji@yahoo.com><nttawo@gmail.com>
<br>A life of constant communion with the Holy Spirit can revolutionize your destiny into a testimony. I was given John 14:12-18 which contain a great prediction by our Lord Jesus and how it shall come to pass through the Holy Spirit whom He just introduced his disciples. Jesus said that anyone that believes on Him shall do great works and He went further to declare that he shall do even greater works. Previously, I have heard people said that this scripture means that all believers shall be able to do more miracles in terms of quantity and not necessarily quality than Jesus since Jesus was only limited in one physical body in one place at a time when he walked the earth.
<br>However, the Holy Spirit pointed out to me that our Lord Jesus said anyone that believes on him and not just everyone that believes on him shall do great works and even greater works. This means that every believer has the spiritual potential to experience all the miracles of Jesus and even more. There was no miracle that Jesus could not do when He was on earth but there were some that He would not do such as healing people with AIDS, cancer and several other infirmities simply because they were not existing in the world at that time. The Lord foresaw more troubles in our days that were not common in His days and provided greater miracles to our credit to settle them.
<br> You remember the compassionate story of the The Good Samaritan. He took the man that was robbed and beaten almost to death by armed robbers. The Good Samaritan paid the medical bill of the victim and promised to do even more at his return if he incurred more bills.  Luke 10 :30-35. Jesus was the Good Samaritan  in that parable that presented oil and wine which are symbols of the Holy Spirit and the Host is the HolySpirit himself. The devil is that thief that came to steal, kill and to destroy that man until he was left half dead. John 10:10. Our Good Samaritan has gone into heaven but never left us helpless as He has committed us to the care of the Holy Spirit. So just in case you have been robbed of your promotion, opportunity, character, inheritance or anything precious to you, the anointing of the Spirit shall restore it unto you now in the mighty name of Jesus. The Holy Spirit is the reason that John 4:4 declares ' greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world'. Beloved, can you see that you are a carrier of greatness. In this 2014,there shall be a release of indisputable  greatness through your life to everything that concerns you. God spoke to Moses that those that doubt the voice of the first sign shall be persuaded to believe him  by the voice of the second sign. Exodus 4:8. God is releasing a special miracle upon you that shall turn your mess into a great message. God is about to bless you in such a strange dimension that even if you want to hide it from your enemies, it can't still not be hidden. All your enemies must not die yet as some need to live to see the table of prosperity that God has prepared for you. Psalms 23. I prophesy unto that you shall not only be divinely removed from the jobless statistic but you shall become an employer of labour. Right now, the prophetic anointing is redeeming you from all the regrets of the past and miracles are overtaking your mistakes. You will go from borrowing to lending, from begging to blessing many. Your success in 2014 shall exceed the expectation of many, including your family members and friends. Surely, those that have looked down on you shall look up to you. I prophesy that the gifts, skills and talents of God on your life shall expose you to great men and partners in destiny. Go forth with the Spirit of this prophecy and possess your great greatness in this 2014 in JESUS mighty name.&nbsp;<br></nttawo@gmail.com></bishopvictororji@yahoo.com></nttawo@gmail.com></p></blockquote>
