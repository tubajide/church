                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4"><nttawo@gmail.com><bishopvictororji@yahoo.com><nttawo@gmail.com>&nbsp; &nbsp; Favour is the divine flavor in the life of a man for a colorful destiny. There is nobody in the Bible that enjoyed a great destiny that was not highly favored by God. In these days of ever changing principles of success in life, business and relationship by different authors and motivational speakers, it is high time we are reminded of the ancient secret of success that distinguished all of our Bible heroes.  For example, Joseph was an epitome of favour. When his father-Jacob got him a coat of many colors, which was a symbol of favour, it marked the beginning of his prophetic dreams for his future.  In the land of Israel, when an individual has a coat of colors, it implies that such an individual is exempted from manual labour. That is the reason Jacob had to send Joseph from home to the field, to supervise his elder brothers when the tradition demands the reverse to be the case.  By the favour of God coming upon you now, you shall successfully break records in your family and environment.</nttawo@gmail.com></bishopvictororji@yahoo.com></nttawo@gmail.com><br><nttawo@gmail.com><bishopvictororji@yahoo.com><nttawo@gmail.com>
<br>    As a result of the high level of corruption in our society today, the upright people can hardly receive their fair share in anything without various temptations to compromise. As the saying goes," if you can't beat them, you join them". Nobody needs to look far to see the gross inequalities in every sphere of our public and private sectors. Societies create laws in order to give everyone equal opportunity, but unfortunately those same laws are often manipulated to the advantage of the leadership and to the disadvantage of those that the laws are meant to protect. For instance, the objective of government in providing education scholarship is to enable hardworking students from poor or average families attend a leading institution in their field of interest to enhance their competitive skills. However, nearly 50% of government funds on scholarship in Nigeria are 'enjoyed' as mere pocket money by some of the children of the wealthy politicians and their friends. They fill the names of their preferred candidates for scholarship even before the test results are out.  The only way to escape the great corruption due to wickedness that abound in our society and even enjoy undeserved promotion in righteousness is by favour. There are 2 major things that hinder the favour of God from changing a person's story unto glory. Firstly, when a person puts confidence in his natural abilities, he or she will frustrate grace. For instance, when a lady believes that her beauty alone can attract the man of her dream, she is frustrating favour and may either stay single for too long or marries the wrong person in a hurry. Also when a man believes that his success in career is a product of his hardwork, he will frustrate favour from enlarging his capacity for great prosperity. Hardwork and beauty are good but it's impossible for you to become all that God has planned for your life without favour. I have found out that most people's frustrating experiences in life come by trying hard to work out what God has ordained only favour to handle. Secondly, people hinder God's favour by merely chasing after man's favour.  It is possible for a man to favour you and God's favour is not in it, but it's impossible for God to favour you and men will not pursue after you with favour. The favour of man without God is like buying a product on credit, you enjoy the gain now and endure the pain later. The natural man would always find a way of collecting back his favour either in cash or in kind. A natural man loves to blow his trumpet each time he shows favour to anyone. In fact, the favour of man is not really favour but at best can be described as simply 'a good luck'. This does not mean that we should not appreciate those that have contributed to our success but we must not forget that God is our ultimate source. As a matter of principle, I have learned to dissociate myself from anyone that is kind to me but does not see it as simply rendering service in obedience to God. I do this to prevent the individual from coming under divine judgement as I have vowed to always give God all the glory in my life. I know this may seem as a hard decision for some people but when you realize that God has more than a thousand ways to always meet your every single need, you will focus more on Him to enjoy real favour among men.  Again, when we put more confidence in the gifts of favour upon our life such as beauty, wealth, intelligence and connections more than the Source of our  favour -GOD, we lose the right to enjoy them..
<br></nttawo@gmail.com></bishopvictororji@yahoo.com></nttawo@gmail.com><br><nttawo@gmail.com><bishopvictororji@yahoo.com><nttawo@gmail.com>For by one man's offence death reigned by one: much more they which receive abundance of grace ( unmerited favour) and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one; Jesus Christ. Romans 5:17. It takes humility both to obtain favour and to maintain it. The first step of humility towards favour is repentance unto God. It takes favour to enjoy a life of victory over sin. Many people have been taught that favour leaves your life the moment you commit sin whereas it really takes favour to overcome all manner of sins and poor habits. What you lose by living in sin is consciousness of favour but the reality is that it is the  goodness(favour) of God that eventually leads you to repentance. Jesus even said that no man can come to Him except the Father who sent Him draws the person. This simply means that it takes more than self determination to overcome sin, you need favour to enjoy holiness.  I remember my days of courtship, I always tell the devil each time he suggests lust to my mind that I know in my heart that I really don't deserve the pretty lady that God has given me to marry. So how could I be so ungrateful to God by sleeping with her before marriage. That simple awareness of favour kept my relationship in purity. I pray that favour will deliver you from every habit contrary to your colorful destiny in life in Jesus Name, Amen. Receive the coat of colors to reign in prosperity in the midst of any lack and want. I prophesy that the same God that took Joseph from prison to palace will baptize you with favour to soar as an eagle upon the high places of honor in life, relationship and business in JESUS name.
