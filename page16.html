                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4"><nttawo@gmail.com><bishopvictororji@yahoo.com><nttawo@gmail.com>Temptation is an attempt of the devil to lure you into sin. Temptation is not a sin because Christ was tempted at all points and yet He was without sin. Many people think that being tempted with an ungodly desire is sin and therefore feel hopeless about resisting temptation. You need to be aware that temptation is not sin but only an invitation to sin, just as an invitation to a night party which you can turn down. You can only overcome temptation but you can never outgrow it. There is no level in Christianity that guarantees spiritual immunity against temptation. In fact, for a person not to be tempted means that he is not important enough to disturb the activities of the enemy against his destiny.</nttawo@gmail.com></bishopvictororji@yahoo.com></nttawo@gmail.com><br><nttawo@gmail.com><bishopvictororji@yahoo.com><nttawo@gmail.com>
<br>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin when it is finished , bringeth forth death. Do not err, my beloved brethren. James 1:14-16. Every temptation begins at the center of your desire. Devil does not tempt you with something that is not already within your desire. The first character of the devil that was mentioned in scripture is deception. Genesis 3:1. Deception is giving a good report of what is wrong and making evil feel alright. There is no legitimate temptation without some form of  pleasure or opportunity to satisfy an urgent need. Devil exploits your area of discontentment to offer you a short term  pleasure with a long term pressure. A man that is contented in any area of life cannot be tempted of the devil in the same place. Indeed, godliness with contentment is a great gain. From the first temptation in the bible, you will understand that the devil is specialized in 3 areas of deception and they have been the same pattern all through the ages. Even against our Lord Jesus, devil also tempted Him in these 3 ways in the wilderness. Can you now see why the scriptures say in 1Corinthians 10:13 that no temptation has overtaken you except that which is common to man but with the temptation God shall make a way of escape so that you can bear it. These 3 areas of devil's temptations which are just the same yesterday, today and till tomorrow are listed in 1 John 2:15-16. Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: But he that doth the will of God abideth for ever.
<br></nttawo@gmail.com></bishopvictororji@yahoo.com></nttawo@gmail.com><br><nttawo@gmail.com><bishopvictororji@yahoo.com><nttawo@gmail.com>1. The Lust of the flesh
<br>2. The Lust of the eyes
<br>3. The Pride of life
<br></nttawo@gmail.com></bishopvictororji@yahoo.com></nttawo@gmail.com><br><nttawo@gmail.com><bishopvictororji@yahoo.com><nttawo@gmail.com>These 3 things are not just some things that are in the world but rather all that is in the world. I need you to also note that there is a difference between God's test and devil's temptation. The reason I want you to mark this difference is because if the devil can convince you that God is behind your temptation, your power to say no to that ungodly desire/habit is broken as nobody can resist God. For instance, some people believe that they are naturally attracted to the same sex for relationship and they cannot resist the way 'God' has made them which is a lie of the devil. Please note that God's test comes for your promotion while temptation comes for your demotion. God's test is to encourage your heart to trust Him more so that He will enlarge your greatness. But temptation is devil's scheme to encourage you to trust your flesh until he makes a fool out of you. Please don't be afraid of divine test, because God doesn't test babies but only the matured in Christ who desire His double promotion. Another point you must understand about temptation is that the devil doesn't waste his shots of deception because he knows he has but a short time. So devil actually waits for an opportune time before he strikes. When the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from Him until an opportune time .Luke 4:13. There are 4 things that create an opportunity for a temptation to thrive which you must learn to resist
<br></nttawo@gmail.com></bishopvictororji@yahoo.com></nttawo@gmail.com><br><nttawo@gmail.com><bishopvictororji@yahoo.com><nttawo@gmail.com>1. WEARINESS .
<br>Weariness is a state of physical or emotional fatigue. Jesus was tempted when he was hungry. Esau sold his birthright when he was weary and hungry. Samson was the strongest man that ever lived and yet he yielded to Delilah' temptation after her much persistence had wearied him. Judges 16:15-18. Don't ever make an important decision when you are weary. A weary soul rarely makes a wise decision. Most temptations that we fall victims are often the avoidable ones which we simply put confidence in the flesh for victory. Greater is he that avoids temptation than he when tempted overcomes. It is foolish to trust your flesh, because it is in the nature of the flesh to romance with temptation. For instance, the power of immorality is in secrecy. If you can avoid dark places with a sex partner, you have broken the power of that ungodly affair.
<br></nttawo@gmail.com></bishopvictororji@yahoo.com></nttawo@gmail.com><br><nttawo@gmail.com><bishopvictororji@yahoo.com><nttawo@gmail.com>2. ANGER
<br> A man that is soon angry dealeth foolishly. Proverbs 14:17
<br> It is not a sin to be angry but anger can easily lead to sin. Anger is an expression of hate. Contrary to popular opinion, anger is not a sign of strength but great weakness . If small things can provoke your anger then big things can kill you. Have you not heard that anger dwells in the bosom of a fool? A man of self control is greater than the mighty. Many people have destroyed a relationship just in a moment which took them over a decade to build because of anger. It is also written that an angry man will suffer a great punishment. Even in the world of business, your anger can give a wise opponent an advantage to win a negotiation.
<br></nttawo@gmail.com></bishopvictororji@yahoo.com></nttawo@gmail.com><br><nttawo@gmail.com><bishopvictororji@yahoo.com><nttawo@gmail.com>3.  LONELINESS
<br> Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. For if they fall, the one will lift his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth ; for he hath not another to help him up. Ecclesiastics  4:9-10.
<br>Loneliness is an emotional state of feeling deserted and abandoned. Loneliness is a social disease that is luring many people into a life of depression. There is a difference between being alone and feeling lonely. A person can be alone for good so that he can devote time for self development and deeper intimacy with God. But feeling lonely can occur even when a person is in the midst of a multitude of friends. Loneliness is a result of yielding to the temptation of self condemnation . Self condemnation can kill faster than all virus, bacteria and fungi diseases put together.  You need to know that there is NOW no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. Romans 8:1. Don't let the devil run your life crazy in the endless struggle to make up for your past mistakes because the blood of Christ already settled the wrongs of your past. Just accept God's forgiveness now and see God move you forward into better relationships with people.
<br> </nttawo@gmail.com></bishopvictororji@yahoo.com></nttawo@gmail.com><br><nttawo@gmail.com><bishopvictororji@yahoo.com><nttawo@gmail.com>4. BAD COMPANY
<br>Be not deceived; bad company corrupts good manners.1 Corinthian 15:33
<br>The most important company in the world is not Microsoft , Shell or Dangote but your company of friends. The company you keep determines what accompanies you and what accompanies you determines what you accomplish in destiny. The devil uses bad company around a person to introduce a bad habit to him that will tempt and torment his destiny. It was in the midst of bad company that Peter denied Jesus 3 times. It was also in the  midst of bad company that Judas betrayed Jesus. Surely, a bad company complicates your destiny. The company of friends in your life now is a prophecy of your future. Bad company is not just limited to the wrong friends around you but also every material such romantic books, occultic books, pornography,  dirty TV programmes and social networks. Watch and pray, that you enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. Matthew 26:41
<br> Finally, When Jesus was tempted of the devil, he kept saying " it is written". Anybody who doesn't know what is written will soon become a write off. Jesus said watch and pray so you do not fall into temptation. You watch by meditating on the word of God and you pray by speaking forth the word unto God. Do you see that Jesus did not say we should pray and watch but rather watch and then pray. I said this to buttress the point that praying without watching upon the word will not deliver you from any temptation. The power of prayer is the word of God in the prayer. Saturate every area of weakness in your life with the word of God so that you may withstand any form of deception from the pit of hell. Surely, your day of winning every temptation has finally come. Pastor Victor<br></nttawo@gmail.com></bishopvictororji@yahoo.com></nttawo@gmail.com></p></blockquote>
