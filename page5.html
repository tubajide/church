                <h5 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style mb-2 display-7"><strong>Supernatural healing</strong></h5>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">On a faithful Sunday morning I received an emergency call that my sister who just put to birth is in a grievous and critical health condition of profuse bleeding as she has taken 15 pints of blood and more was required to arrest the condition. I sent in some money for more blood to be procured that same week and then I turned the rest over to God.
<br>
<br>As I vehemently believed for her perfect healing, I had a dream in the early hours of the following Sunday, while on my way to the church I used to attend, a voice asked me to enter HeavenWorld Church and all shall be well.
<br>
<br>When I woke up from the dream, I dressed for service though I had no intention to go to church that day. I got to the HeavenWorld Church, met the brethren in worship as I did see in the dream. Just before the word ministration, Pst Victor just went on stage and prophetically announced that there is someone in the Service whose sister is suffering profuse bleeding after child birth, that God has just supernaturally healed her. These all unfolded as I saw it in the dream.
<br>
<br>I immediately called after church service and she pointed out that somehow she feels supernaturally healed and she will leave the next day. I couldn’t contain the joy in my heart when I heard that. I return all glory to God since then both my sister and her baby are very healthy and strong! <br><strong>Bro Ekon</strong><br></p></blockquote>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">On the 6th of April about 1:30am, God blessed my wife and I with a beautiful baby girl after a very&nbsp; challenging labour experience. When our baby was delivered, she was breathless and was immediately taken to the emergency ward. I kept declaring that she shall live and not die and God answered me. Soon after, She became stable and my wife was stable too.
<br>
<br>However, on the 8th of April, two days after she was born, i got a call about 2am that I should come to BMH that my baby who was yet to be discharged was passing out blood and she urgently needs blood transfusion. I ran down, my blood group did not match with her. I tried calling about 8 persons and could not get any donor and time was running out on us as she had passed out too much blood.
<br>
<br>The doctor said that her blood level was only 20% which was very critical. I was exhausted and confused and at about 1:00pm I finally called pastor Victor, he prayed and said that God has fixed it and he was going to call me back. I was still shaking because there was no time left again and no donor yet as they only need a fresh blood and not the one at the blood bank.&nbsp;But 45 minute after pastor prayed, we were still thinking of what to do and then the doctor sent for me. When I got there he said something has happened,&nbsp;that the blood level has gone up to 38% which is normal and stable. I&nbsp;cried because at that point i knew it was only God that could have done&nbsp;this for us. Brethren, God still does miracles in our time. My baby is 3 months now and doing just fine with the mother (my wife). God is good forever.

Some people thought I was being arrogant for not answering when they call my name. But they never knew what I was suffering.<br>But thank God, during the HeavenWorld workforce meeting with Pastor Victor, while praises was going on, without prayer or whatever, the ear just popped open. It was like a dream but I'm glad it was and it is still a reality. Praise God!<br><strong>Bro Nzube W</strong><br></p></blockquote>

I repeated the scan and got the same report. I was advised to go to India for medical operation since the ailment was on a critical stage. I came to Pastor Victor and He prayed for me. I left, but the pain was still there. After few weeks, I called him to remind him of the condition, so He told me not to worry and that he was going to deal with it on his knees. Pastor asked me to go for another medical test. I believed God and then proceeded to Federal Medical Centre, Umuahia for further scan, I was checked by a group of professionals and after several scans and rescanning, the kidney stones had passed out, nothing was found.<br>Thank You Lord.​<br><strong>Brother W.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">I stand to testify of the supernatural healing in my body. Before I joined HeavenWorld Church I have lived with waist pain for 9 years which defiled every prescribed medical treatment.  I even went as far as to Herbal and Native Doctors seeking for healing with all effort ending in futility. In fact, it aggravated the pain such that I couldn’t stand for a long time.<br>In the process of time I met Pastor Victor Orji who prayed for me and told me that the devil oppressing me has gone and in my heart I thought just like that.<br>When I got home I still felt the pain and even related my experience in the church with some friends. However as I slept that night I saw a vision where an Angel walked up to me and said that the spiritual part has been done, it is time for the physical part to be done. He asked me to lie down for an operation which I did and he operated on me. I woke up to discover that the pain is gone. I did the things I couldn’t do before then and behold the pain was indeed gone. Praise God!<br><strong>Bro George</strong><br></p></blockquote>

I woke up and surprisingly it was feeling pain at the same place where the doctor placed his hands on in the dream. That morning I went to ease myself I discovered I was stooling blood. After sometimes I felt pressed, again I was stooling blood. All kinds of fearful thoughts and imaginations started racing through my mind. I was really scared because in the dream I was told I had a terminal disease. I booked an appointment with pastor, he served me communion with a simple prayer and God in the infinite mercy after the communion and prayer the anointing terminated the so called terminal disease. The blood condition stopped. Now am completely free. Praise God.

The following day I received a call from a Professor in UNIBEN informing me with an apology that my name was erroneously omitted in the last years’ admission list. I thought this to be a scam therefore I cut the call. To my uttermost surprise the Prof called back and asked me to verify by checking again the school notice board.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">I want to thank God for what he did for me through the ministry of Pst Victor who is my mentor. He gave me several prophecies on 1st January that in 2015 that I will get admission to do my post graduate programme. Secondly, that God is giving me a new home in the 2015. Thirdly, that he sees me teaching God's word in class room with uncommon wisdom. Fourthly, that the anointing of a sherphed was coming on me for a ministry exploit in 2015 and more astonishing was that he even told me the timing for the fulfillment of most of the words. My first testimony is that the admission I expected last year and even lost hope since the school session had begun finally came on 20th January at Michael Okpara University Umudike, to do PGD AGRIC BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT. This soon led to the fulfillment of the 2nd prophecy as I now live in a wonderful place in Umuahia. The 3rd and 4th was a major prayer point in my 2015 list on the direction to take in the area of ministry. On the 24th January I received a confirmation from God that I should start a campus church in that territory and as I write now the work has started according to the prophecy. Pastor Victor also prophesied to my friend whom I brought along with me and said that God was about to restore peace to his family and that word expressly came to pass that same day as a long strife among his family members ended later that evening. I bless God for all these great works and also thank God's prophet who he used.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">The Lord once put a burning desire in my heart to do some tangible things regarding beautifying the church but I had no immediate resources to do this. I prayed about it and dedicated with my wife to sow a seed as a sign to the Lord that we believe in his ability to provide me with resources to see my heart desire fulfilled. A few weeks down the line, in a church service, the man of GOD under the unction of the Holy Spirit and pointing towards my direction, announced that the Lord was about to ignore somebody’s weary and almost zero faith (due to some delays) to bless him beyond his imagination. I knew instantly that this was my moment and I believed him with all my heart. Within the next three weeks a lot of surprising things happened, culminating into a transfer of millions of Naira from an unlikely source resulting in my ability to furnish the house of God. The Lord is truly awesome!

Before the Notable Testimony, I decided to join a department in Church to prepare myself for a better relationship with God. During the 2nd day of the Notable Testimony, my phone was on silence. Just while prophetic ministrations was going on by Pst Victor for instant breakthroughs, suddenly, I walked to the Ladies Rest room and checked my phone and saw 10 missed calls. I returned the calls but none responded. Then a call came in later and when I picked he asked where have you been? We've been trying to reach you? We wanted you to speak with the MD of a big federal government agency. Then i said i was in church Oo. He said she's gone(the MD). Then I went inside the church and started praying and told God, have I really missed this offer? I was nowhere else but in your presence. If really it's for me, please make a way. When I got home that night at about 11pm a text came in with the number of the MD saying that I should go to her office the next day at noon and drop my papers for employment.  To the Glory of God, that was how my miracle job landed!

However, after prayers the man of God told me that God revealed to him that the owner will still reduce the price further by N500,000 to arrive at N5.5M purchase price. Though it sounded too good to be true, I believed this prophecy because previous prophecies that God had given me through him have proved to be very accurate.
<br>So, I called the owner again and he agreed at the new purchase price of N5.5M within 30 minutes just as the man of God had prophesied and I bought the property at that N5.5M reduced price the next day.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">I have been trusting God for a life partner. Earlier this year on the day of Notable Testimony, while Pastor was prophesying, he saw me carrying my sister’s kid. He walked towards me and told me that the babe I was carrying is not my child, that he was seeing my wedding gown where I was dancing. He asked me to drop the child and come and receive my own partner that this year will not pass me by. He said that for a long time I would have gotten married but the yoke of the wicked against my family prevented it and he commanded it to be broken. Shortly thereafter, I met my husband and by September 27th we were happily married in Church. It was amazing. All Glory to Jesus.<br><strong>Sis. Oma</strong><br></p></blockquote>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">It all started in the university. Sleeping at night was the worst thing ever. At about 2amevery morning, I felt this demonic presence of something I couldn't explain with lots of pressure on me. I would barely hear myself when I speak, calling the name of God was impossible. I told a friend about it and I was introduced to a certain prophet, after much work nothing changed. I did my usual prayers and hoped one day these nightmares will be over. At a point I'm sure the spirit got tired and reduced its attacks due to my much sufferings. Finally, I graduated and was posted to Port harcourt for my NYSC. It continued but on a different level as I barely slept in the house I rented as it forced me to always stay with a friend. One day I was at a friend's place, it was hot and I took something to fan myself some air. When I looked at what I was holding, it looked attractive so I read what was in it 'Voice of Prophecy'. After reading the testimonies. I called the number I saw below and was given an appointment. The day I met with Pastor Victor all he said was a short prayer. At a point, I almost felt disappointed that after all these years of torture and much spending on prayers with the other prophet, all Pastor Victor did was to tell me to go and that I'm free. Sincerely, after that prayer, I returned to my house and unknowingly I slept off and woke up the next morning. Surprised at myself that I slept like a baby without oppression or fear and so has it always been since that day. Glory to God!. <br><strong>Sister Deri&nbsp;</strong><br></p></blockquote>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">We lost our first baby last year through caesarian section. The same year my wife became pregnant again which is not medically wise because we were supposed to wait for at least 1 year or two.<br>But when I joined HWC I knew affliction will not rise up the second time. Pastor gave me assurance that nothing will go wrong this time around despite our impatience as God will surely grant us a safe and sound delivery.<br>When my wife's people learnt she had taken in again. They quickly informed her about a god in her village that we must appease which we refused to do during our marriage traditional rites, or else she will keep losing her children during delivery. Pastor Victor still reassured us that those gods are nothing but dogs and that we shall have a testimony. The first challenge of my wife’s pregnancy was the baby was in breach form but God turned the baby to its normal position. Again, the placenta blocked where the baby is to come out from, even the head of the baby was touching the placenta but God supernaturally moved the placenta to its normal position to the doctor’s surprise. And then the day came oh what a day of joy, God gave us a bouncing baby boy without operation or any form of complications despite the threats of the enemy and against all medical odds, God won Himself a great victory and gloriously confirmed the word of His servant, all glory be to Jesus. <strong>Anyanwu M</strong><br></p></blockquote>

Praise God, that was how the yoke of 8 years of heavy witchcraft oppression got terminated and a close relation who was behind it came out openly and confessed. It was a mighty deliverance for me and my family. Infact, our joy knew no bound.
<br>Also pastor gave me another prophecy concerning the financial loss I suffered, that I will receive ten fold restoration. That was exactly what happened and from a source I least expected.

It was devastating for me but amazingly, on the 18th of August, I got a call from a company I never dropped my CV. I went there immediately and I was told to resume work on the following Monday. The startup salary was far better than my current job and an official phone and a weekly recharge card was given to me.
<br>That was not all, after two weeks, a friend came back from US and gave me three Samsung phones, iPhone expensive phones more than what the enemies stole from me.
<br>The word of my papa came to pass, a better job and favor. I couldn't believe my eyes as it all happened like a dream. All glory to Jesus. <br><strong>Sis Pat</strong><br></p></blockquote>

He eventually travelled out in July 2016 for studies. On getting there, he started applying for job thinking it will be an easy one. He applied to so many companies and all to no avail.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Last year, I purchased my master's degree form, paid for my transcript in January and all other requirements for master program and traveled back to Abuja. After two months, I was told the list is out and my name was not there. So I decided to come back to Port Harcourt to see things for myself, it happened that it was true and I was heartbroken. I went to the school Admin. and asked why my name didn't come out, they said my transcript I paid for since January was not ready and admission has ended within the post graduate School. Then I decided to lay the complain to the Dean, she told me sorry that admission has also ended and there is nothing​ she can do.  I left school but did not accept what they told me because to me only God has the final say. I called Pastor Victor of Heaven World Church on phone and tabled all that transpired with me, the Dean and the admissions office. Pastor Victor now asked me what do I really want and I said I need the admission and my name to be on the list of the school. He prayed a very simple prayer for me and said "it is done" I accepted it by faith and left the case for God to handle. By that week thursday I came to church and after the midweek service, Pastor saw me and said to me that they are working on it. Without wasting time the next day I went to school, lo and behold they were working on my transcript that was abandoned and by Monday it was the school that called​ me and told me that they are processing my admission and that my name will be the first on the list because the VC has given approval for another list.  I laughed​ because it was not the VC but God used the VC and gave him the final word and it was done as it was said by Pastor Victor. I want to you to know that God's word is the final word in your life and not that of man. Thank you Jesus!

On the first tarry night I was seated at the back and Pastor Victor Orji gave a word saying I see you getting a job and I see you working international. I held on to the word... the following week I was called by my cousin that someone needed an executive assistant if I was interested, I said yes.. I went for the interview the following week after the interview, I was asked if have valid visas, I stated my valid visa and resumed the work. In the course of the job I travelled and had opportunity to attend Harvard business school for a course. While on the job I had pressures from my boss but I refused all the time he made advances and lost the job due to several of these incidents. When Pastor Victor got to know about the situation, he prophesied yet again that God takes away the first that He might establish the second. After a few months, a lady called my sister and said that she was looking for someone who can stand in as an assistant because the job was telling on her and her family so she needs someone to manage her company. She deals with supply of oil equipments which entails travelling in and out of the country to source. To the glory of God, the same international standard of job that was prophesied came again with better package.. I'm grateful to God in all.

I got into school in 2008 for a 5 year course but ended up spending 2 extra years in the university. After I wrote the final exam, the first &amp; second result list came out but my name was nowhere to be found. I went back to my HOD only for him to tell me that I had missing results that I should go home and prepare myself to come and sit for another exam. Initially I couldn't believe it, especially how to break such sad news again to my parents?. I lost my self confidence. I made crying my hobby. Finally, I came here and met Pastor Victor after a Sunday service. Pastor Victor simply declared that God will honor me with favor and that I will come back with a special testimony. Honestly, I was scared to go back to school and check for my grades again because I had already lost hope. But all thanks be to God that a miracle surely did happen that today I can boldly say I am a GRADUATE. Moreover, I graduated with two lower class unlike anyone I knew that had similar challenges. God used His servant to wipe away my tears and gave me good grades. I return all glory to God. <br><strong>Sister Oluchi</strong><br></p></blockquote>
