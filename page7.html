                <h5 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style mb-2 display-7"><strong>For a righteous man may fall seven times and rise again, but the wicked shall fall by calamity. Prov. 24:16</strong></h5>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">I have been privileged to study the biographies of many high-impact people from different walks of life and have had the opportunity to meet with a few in our society. One common denominator that they all possess is their ability to overcome the fear of failure and to never give in to the shame and discouragement that comes from failing. However, there is something wrong when you are failing and still failing without even knowing when the failing will finally end in your life. Many people are failing morally, financially, professionally and sexually and they are busy seeking all manner of self-help strategy to break free without following the right ways of obtaining real and lasting victory in Christ. Friend, life is more spiritual than biological or mental calculations. When you have applied all the knowledge you have gathered in any area of life and you continue to experience a recurring failure, you need to begin to deal with the influence of familiar spirits. 
<br>
<br>Familiar spirits are demons that follow an individual family history and work to perpetuate their evil patterns to future generations. Please note that as a believer, you are seated with Christ in heavenly places and blessed beyond any curse from any demon in hell or any man on earth. However, our redemption in Christ does not exempt us from spiritual warfare but only guarantees our victory over all the power of the enemies. 2 Corinthians 10:3-6. The main purpose of familiar spirits is to create evil circumstances in the life of people in order to make them question and doubt the spiritual reality of their freedom in Christ from ancestral or generational curses. Familiar spirits monitor activities of each member of every family to ensure that their areas of bondage against them are maintained through either a specific sinful lifestyle or spiritual ignorance. In fact, some spiritual activities that now push many Christians to ignorantly engage themselves in land deliverance, breaking generational curses, destroying evil foundations are simply the manipulations of familiar spirits. And the reason they keep repeating such spiritual exercises year in year out without completely breaking free from their cycle of failure is because familiar spirits thrive in an environment of ignorance. Familiar spirits are only paralyzed when you know the truth of your total deliverance in Christ and you enforce it by the power of the Word, Name and Blood of Christ Jesus. 
<br>
<br>I will give you two cases of familiar spirits in operation and what our Lord Jesus taught us on how to deal with them. Please read Mark 5:1-20. When the Lord Jesus delivered the mad man of Gadarene, He sent him to tell his family first what God has done for him because familiar spirits were involved in this case. There are 5 spiritual lessons that I want you to note from this story. 
<br>Firstly, your testimony of victory over any familiar spirit will liberate other members of your family or friends that are suffering under the same bondage. 
<br>Secondly, familiar spirits multiply their capacity in number and degree of wickedness when each generation of family members fall for their evil schemes. Therefore, you MUST NO LONGER indulge in the sinful habits that is common to your family or culture so that the rest of your life and your children won't suffer even worse familiar crisis.
<br>Thirdly, no man could tame that man even with chains of iron. Familiar spirits have no respect for your advanced education, social status, financial wealth etc. They provoke people into unclean habits like watching pornography, masturbation, homosexuality, alcoholism, drugs, robbery etc. If they are not dealt with through the power of Christ, they will surely reduce a person to either public disgrace or private shame. I have met many people in the best of worldly fashion and great wealth who are struggling with private shame that they hope will remain secret lest all their public reputation should crumble. 
<br>Fourthly, familiar spirits often drive its victims into a life of isolation in order to perfect their destruction. Most people that I have helped to deliver over the years through the power of God have had a long battle trying to break out of their dirty lifestyle by willpower or through motivational guidelines since they were too ashamed to confide in anyone. Only for them to sink even deeper into the pit of hopelessness. This does not imply that no believer can deal with familiar spirits on his/her own but from the scripture and through personal experiences, it is often easier and better to join forces with an anointed servant of God or other members of your spiritual family in Christ. As the scriptural principle that "one shall chase a thousand and two ten thousand" Deut.32:30 is of utmost benefit in this case. It is also very important to forewarn you now that many people in the quest for deliverance from the activities of familiar spirits have fallen victims of false prophets and preachers that operate through the gifts of this same familiar spirits. It is becoming increasingly difficult in our times to differentiate between true preachers and fake ones due to the seemingly positive results that some of these fake preachers testify and are parading about to deceive many. A fake prophet can discern with high accuracy your problems through familiar spirits and can dazzle you with actual events of your life but can never deliver you completely. In fact, what familiar spirits do when you enquire through a fake prophet is to grant you temporary relief in that area but to begin oppressing you even more in another area of life. Our Lord Jesus warned against the sudden rise of this deception in the last days when many will prophesy revelations without divine solutions to the people. 
<br>The story of the damsel in the book of Acts 16:16-19 who was possessed with familiar spirits and brought much profit to her masters will shock you. Of course the sole target of every fake prophet is your pocket before your soul. All her revelations about Paul and Barnabas were accurate, but were drawing more attention to them than to Christ whom they preach. Finally, Apostle Paul had to cast out the familiar spirits out of her after many days. Likewise, fake prophets can come in the name of God, reveal all about your problems but reveal nothing of Christ's salvation nor your spiritual authority as a believer. If it would take Apostle Paul many days before finally dealing with this familiar spirits, then you better understand that you need spiritual violence to resist these stubborn spirits.
<br>Finally, the reason the demons begged Jesus not to cast them out of that territory but rather to be cast into the swines which are unclean animals according to the old covenant laws is because they cannot survive outside the familiar and the unclean environment. 
<br> When familiar spirits are successfully cast out, they have the tendency to reinforce their team of wicked demons and attack again? Please study Luke 11:21-26. This is the point where those that only engage in deliverance prayers without paying attention to the word of God have problems and keep being deceived by fake prophets. 
<br>Just as nature abhors vacuum, you cannot afford to be empty of the word of God and enjoy total victory over familiar spirits. Sometime ago, I was ministering in church and all of a sudden, God opened my eyes to see a new member who was locked up in a beer bottle and immediately I knew that was the familiar spirit oppressing this fellow. As I walked up to him and shared this revelation, he confirmed it and narrated how alcoholism had ruined his father and other brothers. As I prayed over him, he got free and few weeks after, God blessed him with a great job. You are next in line to testify.
<br>I command your supernatural victory now over every demonic cycle of failure in your life. I would be glad to join my hand with yours and see you and your family break forth with a perfect TESTIMONY to the Glory of God!  Pastor Victor Orji.  08032616080
