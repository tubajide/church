                <h5 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style mb-2 display-7"><strong>Curses are spiritual obstacles that hinder physical progress.</strong></h5>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Curses are negative spells against your positive expectation. Curses are real but much more real are the blessings of God. Curses are tools for demonic operations in the kingdom of darkness just as blessing is a divine tool for operation in the kingdom of God.  Many people are suffering from repeated failures in relationship, business and education not because of what they are doing wrong but due to an evil sentence over their destiny.<br>Our African society is full of victims of witchcraft and astral curses, especially in the villages where many ancient cultures of idolatry still abound. It will be a costly assumption to ignore the realities of curses in our world as even unbelievers and uneducated people in our society know better than that. However, the fear of curses is the beginning of bondage in life and destiny. I feel very sad when I see sincere people, especially believers going from deliverance to deliverance in order to be free from one curse or the other. I have ministered to many people with different curses such as evil dreams, untimely death in their families, marital woes, unnecessary poverty etc and one common denominator behind their evil torment is the fear of these curses. Curses are not defeated by academic knowledge as there are many highly educated people who are very frustrated. Curses have no respect for geographical boundaries as I have seen people who have abandoned their place of origin for years and travelled around the world and yet could not escape from one useless curse. You must understand that the blessing of the Lord is the cure for all manner of curses in life no matter how long they have existed or how strong they have persisted.<br>The good news is that the Cross of Christ crushed to extinction every curse against your life and destiny over 2000 years ago. Just as the rod of Moses swallowed up the rods of the magicians of Pharaoh which they never recovered, the blessing of the Cross of Christ swallows up every curse in your life when you receive Him into your heart. I know what I have just mentioned may appear too weak to be true for some people especially coupled with the fact they have been born again for a long time and even tongue talking. The truth is that a righteous man who does not know his rights in Christ will suffer under curses as much as a sinner who delights in wrong things. That was the reason God lamented that His people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Hosea 4:6. What many actually need is not deliverance from curses but freedom from ignorance which comes by the Truth of Christ’s victory on the Cross and not the facts of your family history or business /relationship tragedy story as many preachers try to demonstrate nowadays even using ‘prophecy’.  There are many preachers in the country now that actually think God issued them ‘deliverance certificate’ to set others free from curses and unless they have prayed for you or tested your hunger level with long fasting, you cannot be free. Now let me warn you to beware of anyone no matter how ‘anointed’ or popular that promises to offer you deliverance which the Almighty Cross of Christ could not offer you at salvation. All these deliverance stories without the Cross of Christ at centre that these preachers testify to magnify their ‘gift of deliverance’ don’t last as they often belittle the power of the Cross. Any deliverance without the Cross of Christ is only a crisis waiting to crash. If you are not prepared to study your bible, attend a good church and listen to sound gospel message that will enable you to grow spiritually, you might fall a victim of these false preachers and they will build their business enterprise on your head. Many of them will employ all manner of ‘spiritual gimmicks’ to invade your pockets such as 3days dry fast, 21 days tarry nights and even 40 days of marathon fasting and prayer depending on how you have magnified your spiritual case or their knowledge of your financial worth. At any event you are unable to carry their ‘spiritual punishment’, you pay a fine or do I say ‘seed faith’ so their prayer group will handle the exercise for you which most never end up doing. <br>I know some of the preachers in this act are sincere but the truth is that they are sincerely wrong. They quote bible passages like Exodus 20:5-6 and I wonder if they don’t also have the book of Jeremiah 31 in their bible where God amended that law and further confirmed it in Ezekiel 18. Just as almost every advanced country in the world like the United States, Canada, United Kingdom etc have had to amend their original constitutions that formed the foundation of their democracy to combat recent developmental challenges that were unforeseen at the beginning by the founding fathers. In the same manner, God who knows the end from the beginning reveals himself to man according to man’s responses to Him. For instance, it was not the will of God for Adam to eat the forbidden tree but because He had given man the freedom of choice, He had to provide the tree of Calvary for man not to suffer an everlasting punishment for his sin. Most curses are consequences of wrong choices against God but when a man receives Christ, he becomes a new creature that is ‘uncur      sable’. As a matter of fact, you will never read any story of deliverance from curse through prayer, fasting or giving in the New Testament as the price was fully paid on the Cross. Being born again is not just a deliverance from sin but also a translation into the kingdom of light where curses are illegal, void and empty. As rich as you may be in naira, if you travel to UK without some pounds in your pocket, you will never carry out any financial transaction there. It is true that both UK pounds and Nigeria naira are financial legal tenders but they are limited within their national boundary. Likewise when you got born again, you were seated far above principalities and powers where curses from hell, demonic shrine and occult kingdom cannot reach. What is real in the kingdom of darkness becomes false in the kingdom of light. Sickness and failure are real curses in the kingdom of darkness but they are reversed by the blessing of God into health and success in the kingdom of God. <br>When next a person wants to deceive you to believe that the sins of your father or mother, or that of your forefathers and foremothers are the reason for your afflictions, please remind yourself 1 Timothy 1:3-7 because everyone born of the flesh has Adam and Eve as grandparents and when a person is born again in Christ, he or she enters into the generational blessing of the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Galatians 3:10-14. When the rich man in hell requested father Abraham to send Lazarus to deep his finger in water to quench his thirst, Abraham clearly told the rich man that there was a gulf between them such that people in hell cannot come over paradise neither can people in paradise go over his side. Luke 16:19-26. That is truly the exact picture even now in the realm of the spirit between the kingdom of light and kingdom of darkness. <br>No curse from any source is permitted to prosper in your life, relationship, kids, business and ministry as you live by the power of the Cross in the kingdom of light.  As true believers we may look simple by physical appearance but we are too spiritually sophisticated for any juju priest, occult master and witches to comprehend. Colossians 2:8-15. When you understand how you have spoilt principalities and power through the victory of the Cross, you will no longer be the oppressed by these so called powers of darkness but rather their oppressor as they will turn out to be the ones going from one deliverance to another for your sake until they bow to our Lord and savior Jesus. <br>PRAISE JESUS FOREVER!<br></p></blockquote>
