                <h5 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style mb-2 display-7"><strong>For many years now, I have enjoyed the divine privilege of understanding difficult dreams, accurately interpreting their times and seasons of fulfillment and helping many people abort bad dreams from reality.</strong></h5>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4"><nttawo@gmail.com><bishopvictororji@yahoo.com><nttawo@gmail.com>There are no spiritual  formulas for interpreting dreams but only through right understanding of scriptural truths or by manifestation of a prophetic grace. When you have a good dream but lack right interpretation, its fulfillment may be prolonged. However, if you have a bad dream and you have a right interpretation, you can turn the evil around for your good. Dreams are spiritual movies in your sleep that are soon to be played in your physical world. Our dreams are made up of a combination of our thoughts, images, and emotions. Understanding your dreams and how to overcome the bad ones can give you a different perspective on how to tackle some tough challenges of life.</nttawo@gmail.com></bishopvictororji@yahoo.com></nttawo@gmail.com><br><nttawo@gmail.com><bishopvictororji@yahoo.com><nttawo@gmail.com> 
<br>    Firstly, I need you to understand that a dream is part of divine means of communication as God visited several people in the Bible through dreams, like Jacob, Joseph, Pharaoh, Daniel etc. However, the devil and the  kingdom of darkness have hijacked the dreams of many people in these last days to cause spiritual pollution and even physical destructions. Therefore, you need a great discernment to identify the sources of your dreams and how to respond to them. There are 3 sources that create our dreams and they are:
<br>    1. Divine Source. 2. Man-made Source. 3. Demonic Source. I have a teaching series titled ' Dreams and Realities' but will be dealing on how to recognize demonic sources and overcome bad dreams in this article. Firstly, I need to make it clear that there is no level of spiritual maturity where it would be impossible to have a bad dream but the good news is that even if you are a new believer, you can always have victory over bad dreams. Having said that, I quickly wish to let you know that some bad dreams that often torment people are as a result of their personal compromise. For instance, a person who is given to pornography, horror movies, alcoholism, drugs and other reckless lifestyles cannot easily escape from nightmares.</nttawo@gmail.com></bishopvictororji@yahoo.com></nttawo@gmail.com><br><nttawo@gmail.com><bishopvictororji@yahoo.com><nttawo@gmail.com>
<br>    Any particular bad dream that has become a recurring decimal is a typical sign of an ongoing problem in your life that you keep ignoring. Do you know that more than 70% of your fears in life were planted in your childhood dreams and most misfortunes that wreak the destiny of people were first spiritually programmed through their dreams?
<br>    I need you to understand that the devil is such a coward that he only waits for men to sleep before he goes about planting his tares and most of his tares are to make you as fearful as himself . Read Matthew 13:24-30.</nttawo@gmail.com></bishopvictororji@yahoo.com></nttawo@gmail.com><br><nttawo@gmail.com><bishopvictororji@yahoo.com><nttawo@gmail.com><br>    Among the top bad dreams that devil uses to defile people are sex and food dreams. I have often heard ignorant deliverance preachers telling believers that sex dreams are signs that a person has a spirit wife or husband. If you are a believer, you are already married to one spiritual husband who is Christ. ' For I have betrothed you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ' 2 Corinthians 11:2 . I really cannot imagine our Lord Jesus, my spiritual husband  sharing my body with a demon of sexual immorality. And so, it is impossible for you to be defiled if you are washed in the blood of Christ. What you need to do if you are having sex dreams is to always sanctify your heart through mediation on the word of God before going to bed. The very last discussion or meditation before you sleep has a tendency to influence over 80% of your dream and so you must cultivate a godly atmosphere before you sleep. I have a habit of playing my Bible DVD all through my bed time and so I always wake up refreshed in my spirit. Friend, You need to be aware that  people who fail to deal with sex dreams often experience: delayed marriage, miscarriage, low sperm count, poor sexual intimacy with their spouse etc, and you need holy anger to crucify and bury stubborn sex dreams or they could frustrate your life. Please don't be deceived by some biological theories that wet dream is normal and yet you keep making love with strange fellows in your dream every night. A man cannot be said to be having symptoms of puberty by always seeing wet dreams when he is already past his teens. Most sexual perversions that are being displayed in many movies from Hollywood, Nollywood and other rotten woods are demonic actions in the dreams of some empty actors and actresses. This is the reason that some of these home videos unleash demonic presence that triggers sexual pressures in the bodies of its regular viewers. It's very interesting that the same Bible that says we should "RESIST the devil and he will flee from us" also warns us to "FLEE from every appearance of evil". The sad truth is that many believers today are trying to resist the appearance of evil when they ought to be fleeing! And they are fleeing from the devil when they ought to be resisting him! Read 1 Thessalonians 5:22/ James 4:7 ( KJV )</nttawo@gmail.com></bishopvictororji@yahoo.com></nttawo@gmail.com><br><nttawo@gmail.com><bishopvictororji@yahoo.com><nttawo@gmail.com>
<br>    There is no way we can overcome the devil in his own game. There is no doubt in the fact that dreams are powerful, but your decisions in life are much more powerful than them.  I encourage you at this hour to decide for holiness and enjoy a life of wholeness.
<br>    Another common dream that torments people is eating in the dream. I believe that this is the most misunderstood type of dream and so it is often a sign of evil for many people. Firstly, I need you to understand that food is not a bad thing and that eating in the dream is not always a bad thing. In fact, it could be a sign of a breakthrough. Hold on. Don't just take my word for it, I will give you at least two scriptures. It was John and Ezekiel  that had a vision and a dream where they were eating scroll. I mean eating a writing paper. Read Ezekiel 3:1-3 / Rev 10:9-10. Most modern interpreters of dreams would have told you that it means they would fail in their academic work.
<br>
<br>    Peter also had a trance where he saw food, in fact unclean animals that were not proper for a Jew at that time to eat and God said unto him " Peter, kill and eat". When Peter objected to obey God due to his Jewish religious belief like most Christians today, God rebuked him by saying " you shall not call common what the Lord has sanctified". Read Acts 10. Again, if you see yourself eating with great people or in a happy ceremony in a dream, get ready for an uncommon breakthrough. But if you find yourself feeding from a dirty plate or poor environment, then get up and rebuke that demonic plot. Standing upon the scriptures that you shall eat deadly things and it shall not hurt you as your heritage in Christ. Also, I encourage you to partake of a holy communion and experience the power of total freedom whenever such a bad dream persists in your life. Please take heed to these instructions faithfully as  those that fail to deal with eating in demonic dreams are often visited with financial misfortunes and unusual crisis. Finally, any dream whatsoever that does not inspire you with joy , you have got to reply them by praying in tongues as soon as your eyes open from sleep or your mind recalls them. Join me for 7 Prophetic Sundays with the theme "Turning Your Bad Dreams Into Good News" by 9am Live from  Sunday April 19th to Sunday May 31st.  As you make it for these divine appointments, every nightmare shall be terminated in your life. Every disease or failure that is planted by the wicked through your dreams shall surely be uprooted by fire. </nttawo@gmail.com></bishopvictororji@yahoo.com></nttawo@gmail.com><br><br><nttawo@gmail.com><bishopvictororji@yahoo.com><nttawo@gmail.com>Every witchcraft manipulation around your family at night shall be disgraced and expelled. As many as have not known good sleep shall begin to sleep well and indeed their sleep shall be sweet. And every good dream of destiny that has be delayed in your life shall suddenly turn around for a testimony to the glory of God. I will see you there. Jesus is Lord!
