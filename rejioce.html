                <blockquote>
                
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">The first prophecy that I released to the public on 1st January this year was a revelation where I saw the economic crisis that was coming upon Nigeria as one Dollar was exchanging above 400 Naira. Some persons that read the prophetic account at the beginning of the year considered it as a mere speculation that was nearly impossible but the reality is now upon us. However, my aim of highlighting this report is to let you know that if God could show us the trouble that was coming, He would have certainly prepared the way of escape for us to be more than conquerors. The Job 22:29 says "when men say there is a casting down, you shall say there is a lifting up". Unfortunately, under the present economic recession, men are saying there is a casting down but we can hardly hear many believers saying there is a lifting up. We must not allow the economical facts in our heads to silence the scriptural truths in our hearts. We cannot afford to spend all our time watching the daily stock markets trading, forex rates and business news alerts without paying any attention to the word of God. Colossians 3:16 says "let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom".
<br>It's impossible to be rich in the Word and be broke in life. The whole world was created by the Word of God. Therefore, it's impossible to have the source of everything and not have resources for anything. Don't just get satisfied with reading the letters of the Word without waiting on the Lord through meditation to encounter the Spirit in the Word. I must warn at this point that you must never set making money as your goal in life but rather you must see it as a tool for reaching your divine goals in life. If all your expected fulfillment in life is tied to financial goals then you have erroneously subscribed to a life of sorrow without knowing. I have met a few rich persons that have more money than a whole lifetime of pleasure would require and yet their lives were as miserable as the beggar on the street.
<br>Do you want to know the reason why many Christians are not enjoying plenty?
<br>The book of Judges in the Bible is a typical experience of many believers. Israel was always falling into idolatry in the days of prosperity and only crying out to God in the days of adversity. There is no single record in the entire 21 chapters of Judges where they ever sought the Lord in their time of plenty. This clearly shows that the reason why many Christians are not enjoying plenty may not be due to a generational curse or even lack of prayers and fasting but simply because they are not prepared to handle it. Money is a bad master but a good servant. God is now raising 'ordinary believers' in these days who will serve Him in extraordinary way with their riches and much more with their time in the kingdom of God as money would no longer dictates their time.
<br>Romans 14:17 "the kingdom of God is not meat and drink but righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit". This definition of the kingdom is in complete contrast of the kingdom of this world which is full of wickedness, war and sorrow in demonic places. As a believer, you are called to manifest the kingdom of God in this crooked and perverse generation. The reason that it appears that the evil activities of this world are making more waves than the glorious righteousness, peace and joy in the kingdom of God is because there are more riches in the hands of sinners than the believers. In this season of recession, there is a divine redistribution of riches as God is positioning his people to possess the wealth of the sinners and nations.
<br><br>If you are a believer, this recession is not designed for your financial and emotional depression but that the riches of God's glory may have more expression in your life. God has not brought you into this season to complain but for people to complement His glory in your life. But if you are not a believer, your future is not secured as this recession might just be the beginning of sufferings. Finally, the same natural pleasure that sex produces in marriage was the original divine pleasure that women ought to enjoy in childbirth. However, due to the fall of Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden after the woman was deceived by the serpent, it became a painful process. Therefore, an expecting mother naturally expects signs of pain before delivery. However, when you are expecting the blessings of the Lord, the way of spiritual delivery is not by agonizing but by rejoicing. God has revealed to me that many believers like Joseph in Egypt are now spiritually pregnant with financial solutions and ideas from heaven that will deliver this nation, institutions and many industries from the present economic bondage. However, many among these people do not know how to deliver their vision and fulfill their divine mission. I have come as a prophetic midwife with a good news from your Heavenly Physician-Jesus, saying, it's your set time to rejoice and push out your financial testimonies. You will not beg for jobs but rather you will employ others. You will not lack bread on your table but rather you will feed the hungry. Receive mercy not to be a victim of the recession problem and the grace to become a solution provider in Jesus name. REJOICE!<br></p></blockquote>
