                <h5 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style mb-2 display-7"><strong>Understanding the Power of Your Choice</strong></h5>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Do you know that God doesn't decide who succeeds in life nor does the devil has any power to determine those that fail. The most important gift that God has given to everyone is the power of choice or ability to make decisions. One of the greatest discovery of the church in the 20th century was that everyone's decision and not necessarily his condition is what determines his destiny in life. God designed everyone with a destiny and gave us the power of decision to fulfill it. Therefore, your success or failure in life is determined by the quality of your decisions. A good experience is the best teacher while a bad experience is the worst teacher. Let me give you a scriptural example of the power of your choice or decision. God sent Moses with a prophecy to deliver the Israelites from the bondage of Pharaoh in Egypt and bring them into a promise land flowing with milk and honey. However, only Joshua and Caleb out of more than two million Israelites that left Egypt entered the promise land because of their wise choices. I wish to let you know that your choice is superior to your prophecy. Many people have frustrated their great destinies with their poor choices. God could have purposed that your marital destiny shall be settled this year but if you are still taking pleasure in premarital or extramarital sex, then you are frustrating the grace for your marital fulfillment. You might have a prophecy that God shall establish your own business outfit this year but if you are not giving your best of services to the organization or individual where you are presently serving, even if they don't appreciate your great sacrifices, you will have a delay of your testimony. Proverbs 18:21. That scripture doesn't say life and success are in the power of God while death and failure are in the power of the devil. You need to know that if you succeed with your life, you have made that area of success easier for others. But if you fail, you have simply failed God and your great destiny. I know this is a hard saying for many, especially in our African society where many people believe whatever will be will be and you can do nothing about it. Many of our cultural songs and arts are filled with this ignorant superstition but nothing could be further from the truth. If words, which is a statement of destiny doesn't mean much to you, then you  will surely  end up small in destiny no matter how hard you try. Great words are major ingredients that constitute great destinies. If you are a type of person that doesn't know what he/she wants, you will always end up with what you don't want. Life doesn't leave any opportunity for those who sit on the fence. According Rev 3:5 indecision is even worse than a bad decision. Foolishness is not making a mistake but just repeating mistakes. You can overcome the foolishness of indecision. I want to show you the secret of making wise choices because life is too short for you to make all the mistakes that you are capable of, as you may spend the rest of your life only trying to make corrections. Wisdom is the ability to foresee the positive or negative consequence of your decision before taking the first action.
<br><br>The story of the prodigal son in Luke 15:16 is a practical illustration of the power of choice. This young man went from riches to rags when he made a stupid decision to demand for his inheritance as he lost patience waiting for his dad to die. When he had wasted his resources and was left without any help, he made another decision that brought him into wealth through his dad. The Dad gave him 3 things that would forever change his life and they were: 1:Robe, 2:Ring, 3: Shoe. Jesus told this story to teach everyone that cares to hear that God has more abundance for anyone than the little blessings that he/she has wasted by all manner of ungodly lifestyles.
<br><br>1-The Robe is a symbol of Righteousness. Righteousness empowers you with the capacity to make wise choices that will stand the test of this life and eternity. One good choice you make will build your confidence to make better choices in the future. However, if righteousness is not your priority in life , you will make choices that may feel good today but will not serve your best interest tomorrow. That a young man feels good about a lady doesn't make it right for both to jump to the bed before the alter. None of us can be wiser than the only Wise God. That a person is hungry doesn't make it right for him to steal. When you live to blame others for your bad choices, you reject the mercy of God to make things right in your life. Don't give in to blame games as it can make you lame in the race of life. Moreover, God doesn't forgive your excuses but your confessions. Be bold to say 'Lord I'm sorry that I messed up, have mercy upon me', whenever you are wrong.
<br><br>2-The Ring is a symbol of intimate relationship. You can't walk with God in all your decisions and be deceived by men or circumstances. Proverbs 3:5-8. As we live in a fast changing world, we need to build our life more on the unchangeable principles of God's word. Don't ever make any life major decisions without a prayer. God doesn't answer to your plans but to your prayers. My best plans are formed in the secret place of prayer. Prayer is not just talking to God but talking with God. The God who gave you mouth has more to say than you do. So listen as you pray and watch how He works on your desires to align them with His perfect plan for your life. Someone said but why won't God just make decisions for us ? and the answer is simple because He doesn't want robots. A wise man said,' there is no true obedience from the heart unless there is every freedom to disobey'. God doesn't want you to serve Him because you are afraid of Him but because you love Him.<br><br>3-The Shoe is a symbol of Royalty. In the time of Jesus, servants walked on bare feet and royal people were among the few adorned with shoes. You need to develop a royal mentality to make wise choices. For instance, there is nothing noble about taking what does not belong to you as it will never make you happy. Walking with a sense of royalty is not pride but a healthy self image. A person with a royal mindset knows that his decisions can impart on the destiny of others either positively or negatively.  As a believer who loves righteousness, God always protects your rights from being abused by the wicked decisions of enemies. And as a person with a sense of royalty, you will always treat others as you would have them to treat you.
<br><br>I pray that God will inspire your heart to embrace righteousness, intimacy with Him and a sense of royalty so that your decisions will honor divine purpose in your life in this season. God shall empower your right decisions with greatness to influence your organization for high productivity. I pray that your decision from now shall nullify all the bad decisions of your past that have been hurting your life. I prophesy that from now, it shall be impossible for you to record another failure over bad decision. It's a new season for you, go forth and enjoy all the success in business, relationship, health and your academic which you have been waiting for in JESUS name.
